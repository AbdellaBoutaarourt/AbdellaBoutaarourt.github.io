# course project web 2 abdella boutaarourt

# description
For WEB2 we had to create a complete website that includes a frontend and backend that are linked to a database that we created for the occasion.

I decided to create a premiere league site where users can search for their favorite team and  save them if they want. They can find information about the team and also the league standing.
a top scorers and top assists table is also avalaible.
